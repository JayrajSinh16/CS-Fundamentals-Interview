# Hub vs Switch vs Router

Brief: Devices at different layers with distinct roles.

## Key concepts
- Hub (L1): broadcasts bits to all ports (legacy)
- Switch (L2): learns MAC table; forwards frames
- Router (L3): routes IP packets between networks; NAT, ACLs

## Practical example
- Modern networks use switches + routers; hubs are obsolete.

## Common interview Q&A
- Why switches reduce collisions? Router vs Layer 3 switch?
