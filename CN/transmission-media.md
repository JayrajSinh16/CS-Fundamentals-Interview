# Transmission Media

Brief: Physical paths for signals.

## Key concepts
- Guided: Twisted pair (Cat5e/6/6a), Coax, Fiber (single/multi-mode)
- Unguided: RF/Wiâ€‘Fi, microwave, satellite
- Characteristics: Bandwidth, attenuation, EMI, latency

## Practical example
- Data center spine-leaf uses fiber for 40/100G uplinks, copper for short runs.

## Common interview Q&A
- Copper vs fiber trade-offs? When choose microwave vs fiber?
