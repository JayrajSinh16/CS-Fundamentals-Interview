# Load Balancing

Brief: Distribute traffic across multiple servers.

## Key concepts
- Algorithms: round-robin, least connections, hash, weighted
- L4 vs L7 load balancers; health checks; sticky sessions
- Anycast for global LB; GSLB with DNS

## Practical example
- Nginx as reverse proxy with health checks and circuit breakers.

## Common interview Q&A
- L4 vs L7 differences? When use sticky sessions?
