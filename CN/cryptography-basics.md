# Cryptography Basics

Brief: Provides confidentiality, integrity, authenticity.

## Key concepts
- Symmetric crypto (AES), Asymmetric (RSA/ECC), Hashes (SHA-2), MAC (HMAC)
- Key exchange (DH/ECDH), digital signatures

## Practical example
- TLS uses ECDHE for key exchange, AES-GCM for bulk, and certificates for auth.

## Common interview Q&A
- Difference between encryption, hashing, signing? What is perfect forward secrecy?
