# Firewalls

Brief: Control traffic based on rules.

## Key concepts
- Packet filtering (stateless), stateful inspection, application firewalls/WAF
- Zones, default deny, allowlist/denylist
- NAT and firewall often combined in SOHO routers

## Practical example
- Stateful firewall allows response traffic for established connections.

## Common interview Q&A
- Stateless vs stateful? Why WAF for HTTP apps?
