# REST API Principles

Brief: Architectural style for scalable web services.

## Key concepts
- Resources and representations; statelessness; cacheability; uniform interface
- HTTP verbs: GET (read), POST (create), PUT/PATCH (update), DELETE (delete)
- HATEOAS (often pragmatic omission)

## Practical example
- Versioning via URL or headers; pagination; proper status codes.

## Common interview Q&A
- Idempotency? REST vs RPC vs GraphQL trade-offs?
