# API Gateway

An API Gateway is a reverse proxy that routes, secures, and manages API traffic for microservices.

## Responsibilities

- Routing and load balancing
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and quotas
- Caching and compression
- Request/response transformation
- Observability: logging, tracing, metrics

## Patterns

- Edge gateway for external clients
- Internal gateway for service-to-service
- BFF (Backend for Frontend) per client type

## Example Policy (pseudo-YAML)

```yaml
routes:
  - path: /api/users/**
    upstream: http://users-svc:8080
    auth: oauth2
    rate_limit: 1000/hour
    cache:
      enabled: true
      ttl: 60s
    transform:
      request:
        headers:
          add:
            X-Request-Id: ${uuid}
      response:
        remove_headers: ["Server", "X-Powered-By"]
```

## Gateway vs Service Mesh

- Gateway: north-south traffic
- Mesh: east-west traffic between services (sidecars)
- Often used together

## Interview Questions

1. Why use an API Gateway in microservices?
2. How do you implement auth at the gateway vs services?
3. Where to place rate limitingâ€”gateway or service?
4. How to handle canary releases via gateway?
5. Compare gateway to service mesh features.
